### USF NSBE Website

The USF NSBE Website project aims to provide a professional, responsive, and informational hub for the University of South Florida chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. This site is built using foundational web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript) and is designed to serve as a clean, reliable resource for our members, the university community, and corporate partners.

The majority of the core structure is complete, and we welcome contributions to build out content pages based on the existing template and styling language.
